# S3 - Simple Storage Service
* It is onee of the main builing blocks of AWS
* It's advertised as "infinitely scaling"
* S3 is used for file storage.

## Bucket
* Bucket is the top-level bulding block in S3. It's like a directory
* Buckets are defined at the region level
* Buckets must have a globally unique name

## Objects
* Objects are equivalent to files
* Each object has a key
* The key is the FULL path: e.g. s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt
* The key is composed of prefix + object name
* There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
* Object values are the content of the body:
	* Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
	* If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
* Metadata
* Tags
* Version ID

## Versioning
* Versioning is enabled at the bucket level
* This feature is safety mechanism and best practice top protect agains overwrites and deletes.
* Notes
	* Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"
	* Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

## Encryption
It is a best practice to use some encryption strategy

* Server-side Encryption:
	* SSE-S3
	* SSE-KMS
	* SSE-C
* Client side encryption
* Encryption in transit is enable through SSL

## Security

* User Based - IAM polices
* Resource Based
	* Bucket Policies
	* Object ACL
	* Bucket ACL

## Bucket Policies
* JSON based policies
	* Resources: buekcts and object
	* Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
	* Effect: Allow / Deny
	* Principal: The account or user to apploy the policy to
* Grant public access to the bucket
* Force objects to be encrypted at upload
* Grant access to another account

## Public Access
* Block public access to buckets and objects granted through
* Block public and cross-account access to bucket and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
* Block by default is considered a best practice

## S3 Websites
It is a feature that allows to host a static website in S3.
* Public Access should be allowed
* CORS should be enabled if an external site is to consume a bucket. CORS is always configured in the server

## Consistency Model
* After a successful write, subsequent reads immediately return the latest version of the object
